KerPy is a Python package meant for various kernel methods, and in particular Deep Restricted Kernel Machines. You can natively perform SVMs, LS-SVMs, (K)PCA with various kernels, automatic centering, out-of-sample, etc.

The package is built on PyTorch and supports GPU acceleration.

## Installation
As for now, there are two ways to install the package.

### PIP
Using pip, it suffices to run `pip install kerpy`. Just rerun this command with the suffix `--upgrade` to upgrade the package to its newest version.

### From source
You can also install the package directly from the GitHub repository.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hdeplaen/kerpy
cd kerpy
python setup.py install
```
